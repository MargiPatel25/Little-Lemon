    <p>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional
        recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have
        a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
        moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

    <p>

        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
        shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a
        chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond
        classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.</p>
